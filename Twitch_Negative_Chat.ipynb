    "- Trying to make a more advanced filter system for Twitch due to recent hate raids/issues with negativity in general during streams\n",
    "- There's been a recent issue with massive amounts of hate raids happening on Twitch, where random streams get invaded by a bunch of random people that spam the chat with hateful comments. These raiders specifically targeted LGBTQ+ and POC streamers in an attempt to kick them off Twitch. This not only negatively impacts the diversity present on the platform, but more importantly can be extraordinarily stressful and damaging to the streamers that are the targets of these raids. Therefore, putting a better system in place to screen for these comments and preemptively mute them until they can be reviewed can help alleviate this stress.\n",

    "- Provide \"cleaner\" chats so better for streamers mental health + viewers (especially if mostly target a young audience, probably want a stricter chat) For the company helps retain diversity as already bad diveristy percentage adn these people tend to be the target of harrassement, diversity good as expands audience and creates open/welcoming space. Also issue of retaining high profile streamers that leave due to lack of support for non-white creators (ie losing Toast who ended up making a bunch of money on Facebook streaming)\n",
