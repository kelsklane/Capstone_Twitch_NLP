    "This project aims to better identify hate chats on Twitch livestreams. A subset of data consisting of four streamers and nine total streams from [this Harvard database](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VE0IVQ) is used in this project. These streams occurred during April - June of 2018. Sentiment analysis is used to identify negative comments which can be used to flag hate chats as they are sent. The relative importance of different words that predict hate chats can also be pulled from the model to help build a better filter. The packages used for this project can be seen in the environment file provided in the repository."

    "## Technical Overview\n",
    "---\n",
    "The data I'm using for this project are chat messages scraped from Twitch livestreams with metadata about the time the message was sent, how far into the stream the message was sent and more. This is suited for the business problem as the aim is to help Twitch more efficiently screen and filter out hate messages, so modeling the sentiment of the messages is a step towards this. To prep the data I used VADER from NLTK to assign a negative or not negative label to each chat. As for cleaning the data I filtered out as many messages sent by bots as I could and got rid of any messages with links using regular expressions, as these are often just advertisements and not real chats. For the tokenization process, I used NLTK's Tweet tokenizer as chats are similar in structure to tweets. I left capitalization and stop words in, as short, casual messages can perform better when retaining this information. Finally, unnecessary punctuation is filtered out and the remaining words are lemmatized to help reduce the number of features. The main two models used for the sentiment analysis are the Multinomial Bayes and Logistic Regression models from sklearn, as these often work well with sentiment analysis and are simple enough to run effectively with the amount of data I have. Sklearn's CountVectorizer was used alongside a custom tokenization function to break the chats up and these vectorizers were tuned using a GridSearch to alter the maximum number of features in the dataset, the frequency cutoff for the higher frequency words, whether bigrams should be used or not, and if the words should all be lowercase or not. The logistic regression model was also tuned, but the only change from the default was to increase the number of iterations. While iterating throughout the models, a train test split was performed and the training data was further cross validated using sklearn's `cross_validate` library. The final model is a logistic regression that has an accuracy of 95% with a recall of 76%."

    "Twitch has an issue with cyberbullying in their chats. According to a [survey done in 2018](https://blog.streamelements.com/streamelements-analysis-on-twitch-bullying-c3f2b2240318), over a quarter of people using Twitch have seen some type of bullying in chat messages. In addition, over 13% of streamers have felt bullied at some point. While Twitch has measures in place for combating bullying, only 26.4% of people thought they were effective. This bullying can have serious consequences for the mental health of not only the streamers, but also the viewers participating in the chat. Therefore, in an effort to help Twitch's safety operations team better tackle this issue and create a safer platform, I propose using a sentiment analysis model to help better identify hate chats. This model can help flag these chats faster for moderators to view and deal with. Words common to hate messages can also be identified and added to existing filters to strengthen them. This can help combat the bullying issue present on Twitch's platform while also creating a more welcoming environment, especially for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ people that are often the target of this bullying."

    "---\n",
    "The dataset for this project comes from a [Harvard study](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VE0IVQ) and contains chat logs from 50 different streamers with around 25 streams per streamer. As the total original data contains too many rows to efficiently run on my computer, I paired the dataset down to four streamers with nine streams total. This means there are two streams per streamer. However, KingRichard has three streams to keep the number of chats at about 25,000 for each person. In the end, this resulted in a dataset with 102,700 rows where each row is a unique chat. When creating the dataset read in below, only chats with the user commenter type were kept, as chats from admins and moderators are not going to contain hate messages. The `fragments` column from the original dataset was broken out into a `twitch_chat` column and `emotes` column to better manipulate the data. The original dataset also contained chats that were edited, though it was never made clear if this was by users or moderators editing the chat for content. Due to this uncertainty and the fact there weren't that many edited chats, any edited rows are dropped. Finally, any chats that start with an exclamation point are filtered out, as on Twitch these are commands used to call bots and are not actual comments. The final dataset was created by merging the nine streams together and dropping the `fragments` and `updated_at` columns, as these supply no additional information. This smaller dataset is imported in the cell below and the code for generating it can be found in the Merge_datasets notebook in the notebook folder."

    "Unfortunately, there are a lot of limitations present with the data. For one, the VADER labeling assigns chats as negative or not negative, but these negative chats aren't all hate. However, there is no neat way to filter out specifically the hate messages from ones that aren’t. While expanding VADER's lexicon can help with identification, models built with these labels will pick up on other negative chats in addition to hate chats. Another limitation is that words can be intentionally misspelled to bypass the filters on Twitch. However, due to the wide variation in misspellings and potential overlap with other words, I didn't attempt to spell check chats to target these words. As a result, there may also be hate messages that slip by. Another limitation is the potential presence of other bot chats aside from the advertisements filtered out earlier. As different streamers can set up custom bots that say different things in response to user prompts, it's not easy to find and filter for all these messages. The streamers included in this dataset are also all well known. As a result, they have more moderators and may actually regulate their chats better when compared to smaller or mid-sized streamers. Therefore, scraping and looking at Twitch chats for smaller streamers would make for more robust data. Finally, the lack of diversity in streamers in the dataset I pulled from originally means that these hate messages may not fully encompass what’s on the platform. As a result, hate directed towards certain minority groups may be underrepresented in the data and not picked up by the models."

While recall is the metric used, I’ve printed accuracy as well to get a sense of how well the models fit. The negative chats are also SMOTEd to account for class imbalance. I tried mixtures of under and oversampling, but simply using SMOTE returned the best results. "

I also tuned this model using a GridSearch and the resulting parameters are used below. While the training recall and accuracy of the random forest are better, it seems to overfit more and the recall for the validation set is much worse. As a result, I opted to stick with the untuned logistic regression as my best model."

Since chats are ultimately being flagged for manual review, mislabeling some neutral and positive chats as negative is a fair tradeoff for capturing as many negative chats as possible.

The confusion matrix for this model is also printed to get a sense of how well the model does overall."

    "The final model overall does fairly well. Due to the recall score and labels coming from VADER, I would recommend implementing the model as a tool for moderators to use to help them sort through chats more efficiently. Therefore, the final model could help flag potential hate comments that would inform moderators faster of potentially problematic chats. Furthermore, the log odds of certain words predicting a negative chat can be drawn out from the model. These can be used to decide what words might be good to add to the chat filter to help improve it."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "---\n",
    "Overall, this model has high potential as a tool to help streamers and moderators identify hate faster. This model can also help strengthen existing filters to make the system more effective. On its own though, the model is still lacking in fully tackling the hate speech problem present on Twitch. Going forward, it would therefore be useful to get more accurate labels for the data to help train a more useable model. It would also be useful to model other languages. Finally, training models for different streaming categories would also be useful, as word contexts change depending on what’s being streamed."
